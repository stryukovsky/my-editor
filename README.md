You need to install NVIDIA drivers:  

https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA

```sh
sudo dnf update -y 
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia 
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda 
```


### Known problems with NVidia drivers:  

Out of range

It seems that there is a problem with HDMI deepcolor which is enabled by default in NVIDIA drivers. Idk if it’s related to higher refresh rates or HDMI versions because changing from 2.0 to 1.4 also solves this (but with the 120hz limitation of 1.4).

To disable deep color you can add “nvidia-modeset.hdmi_deepcolor=0” to /etc/default/grub parameters like this GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="<other-parameters> nvidia-modeset.hdmi_deepcolor=0" and then rebuid grub config using grub2-mkconfig.

Also I don’t know if this can create issues to certain monitors or graphic cards but this fixed it for me.

## Wireguard install
First try in UI Networks add VPN from file. Note file shall be named as `somestring.conf`.  

If failure:

```sh
wg-quick up  ~/Documents/vpn.conf
```

Or `sudo nmcli connection import type wireguard file vpn.conf`

Repeat again interactions with UI.  

## Fedora root password set

Important stuff  

```sh
sudo passwd root
```

And then reboot
